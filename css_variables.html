    <h1>Galaxy</h1>
    A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants,
    interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from
    the Greek galaxias, literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.

    <div class="solar-system">
      <h2>Solar System</h2>
      The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the
      objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects
      that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the
      remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar
      System bodies.

      <div class="planets">
        <h3>Planets</h3>
        A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant
        that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not
        massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its
        neighbouring region of planetesimals.

    <h2>Superman</h2>
    <p>
      Superman is often depicted with a mix of idealism, restraint, fairness,
      and compassion. The Birthright limited series attributes Superman's
      compassion for living things to his ability to see their "auras". He
      also struggles with the differences between what is right and what is
      practical.
    </p>

    <h2>Batman</h2>
    <p>
      Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as "wealth; physical
      prowess; deductive abilities and obsession". The details and tone of
      Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative
      teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiderman</h2>
    <p>
      Spider-Man is capable of tossing about automobiles as if they weighed no
      more than a phone book. Incredible ability and speed. The ability to
      cling to nearly any surface, allowing him to literally walk on walls.
      And an eerie form of ESP that alerts him to potential danger.
